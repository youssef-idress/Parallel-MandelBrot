This is the repository for the first Parallel Assignment from the CSC447 Parallel Programming for Multicore and Cluster Systems course given at LAU.

The main aim of this assignment was to parallelize the serial code of MandelBrot Set problem in two ways, the Static and Dynamic. This repository includes 
the report given to the course Doctor and 3 C files. The C file represent the Serial, Static, and Dynamic implementations (you can access each depending on
the names accompanied by each file).

The report includes an introduction to the problem, breif explanation on the thought process that was given through out the execution of the assignment and 
the performance analysis of each technique.
